# 3D-FoodCalorie üçΩÔ∏èüì∑
**Geometry-Aware Calorie Estimation from a Single Image**

This repository implements a novel three-stage pipeline for estimating nutritional values‚Äîsuch as calorie, mass, fat, carbs, and protein‚Äîfrom a single RGB food image. By integrating semantic segmentation, monocular depth estimation, and RGB-D feature fusion, the system provides geometry-aware calorie predictions that are both scalable and practical for real-world dietary applications.

## üìä Results
### 1. Semantic Segmentation
- **Backbone**: [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) (ResNet-50 + FPN)
- **Dataset**: [FoodSeg103](https://xiongweiwu.github.io/foodseg103.html)
- **Purpose**: Isolate food items from the background to provide object-level granularity.

### 2. Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation
- **Architecture**: PWCNet-based optical flow + lightweight DepthNet
- **Supervision**: Scale-aligned triangulation from dense optical flow
- **Datasets**: Pretrained on NYUv2, fine-tuned on [Nutrition5K](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/Nutrition5k)
- **Output**: Food-specific depth maps, even from monocular input

### 3. RGB-D Fusion & Nutrition Estimation
- **Fusion Backbone**: Dual ResNet-101 + Feature Pyramid Network + CBAM + Non-local attention 
- **Purpose**: Predict five types of nutritional values (calories, mass, fat, carbohydrate, protein) from RGB and depth images.
- **Output**: Calories, Mass, Fat, Carbs, Protein
